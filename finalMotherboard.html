		<p>The motherboard is arguably the most <strong>important part</strong> of a system. This is the point from which every other element 
		and component from your system functions and communicates. Choosing your motherboard, should you build your own system,
		should reserve most of your consideration when selecting your parts.

				<h3><em>Some things to consider</em></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Form Factor</li>
					<li>CPU Socket</li>
					<li>Memory Support</li>
					<li>Chipset</li>
					<li>Other expansion</li>
				</ul>

		<p>
		Consider the items listed when observing your motherboard or selecting a motherboard for purchase. 
		Form factor is very important, as this refers back to what you want to use your system for. A simple home
		thick client computer wouldn't need a large motherboard with several expansion capabilities. Nor would something
		like a home theatre PC need a robust expansion capacity. This is where you must consider what "other expansion" you want to take advantage of. 
		If you are building a system you would like to heavily equip and expand, perhaps get a full sized
		ATX motherboard that boasts more PCI/PCIe slots than a small form factor would. Otherwise micro-ATX is another popular form factor. 
		ITX form factors are typically seen in special purpose systems, so look to see if ITX are for your system.

		Every motherboard has one (sometimes more) CPU socket. Be very careful when selecting your CPU to fit your motherboard.
		There are many different kinds of sockets and each one supports a certain set of processors. Be familiar with your socket and
		what your motherbaord supports. This information can be found in the documentation for your motherboard. Along with the CPU, 
		motherboards support certain kinds, speeds and capacities of memory. Make sure you refer to your documentation to know
		what can and can not fit your motherboard, concerning memory.

		<p>
		Each motherboard has a chipset. A chipset, in simple terms, is what your motherboard offers for peripheral support. How many
		and what onbaord ports are offered with this motherboard? Typically, USB is the predominant interface on a board. Chipset also 
		describes what the motherboard supports for storage interfaces.
