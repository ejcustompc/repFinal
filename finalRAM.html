	Since conventional mass storage access is typically far too slow for our liking, we need another storage medium that allows us to access relevant data
	in a reasonable amount of time. This storage medium is called memory. We call it Random Access Memory, or RAM. Random Access refers to the ability to
	access data directly where it's stored, rather than sequentially. Think of it like a spreadsheet. If you have the coordinates of your cell, you can go directly 
	to it and retrieve your data. RAM is one of three vital components of any computer system. With that comes important considerations to make when buying or
	upgrading.

	The capacity of any memory is usually the most important consideration. If your system is running slow, the go-to solution is to install more RAM (assuming there is 
	no malware on the system). More RAM capacity means more room to work with and more multitasking that can be done. The more applications and activity that is occurring 
	on your system, the more RAM that is taken up. Eventually, all of your RAM will be used up. RAM is considered a "volatile" storage medium. This means that power to the system is required for 
	it to retain the data stored. This is unlike conventional hard rives that are non-volatile. Hard drives load the called data or program in RAM, and the system works on the data out of the RAM.
	Processing would take far too long if the system worked exclusively out of much slower hard drive disks.

	Type of memory is another important specification. Some motherboards do not accept certain types of RAM, so you want to reference your motherboard guide. RAM is typically offered
	as some form of Double Data Rate, also known as DDR. Systems are now incorporating DDR4 modules regularly. DDR4 transfers data at 16x the rate of a standard single rate module. 
	DDR is 2x the standard rate, DDR2 is 4x the standard rate and DDR3 is 8x thestandard rate. Each RAM module also has it's own frequency. Each motherboard also has a limit on 
	how fast a RAM module can operate to work in that particular board. The higher the frequency, and the higher grade of DDR memory you have, the overall greater transfer rate your system
	will be capable of. As stated earlier, the motherboard determines and narrows down your search for what kind, capacity and speed of memory you can put into your system. Some boards can hold no higher grade of memory than DDR3
	and no faster speed than a certain specification. Motherboards also support something called multichannel memory. This effectively multiplies the transfer of data by how many channels of memory are 
	featured on your board. Multichannel memory is typically indicated by color coded memory slots. To take advantage of this, you must pair up like modules into the corresponding colored 
	module slots. Do not vary your type, speed, or capacity when using multichannel features.
