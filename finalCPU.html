		It's fair to say that if the motherboard is the "backbone" of a computer system, then the CPU could be considered the "brain".
		The CPU is a complex, compact set of microchips and circuitry that performs all of the "thinking" and calculating in any computer system.
		If there is no CPU, or your CPU has failed, your system will be unresponsive. It's the first component on the board that fires when you press
		your power button. The importance of the CPU can't be understated. While shopping for one, there are important 
		items one must consider.

				<h3><em>Some things to consider</em></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Size/Power</li>
					<li>AMD/Intel</li>
					<li>Architecture</li>
					<li>Cooling</li>
					<li>Other features (Hyper-threading, Virtualization)</li>
				</ul>

		<p>
		Size and power are easily the most glaring specifications on a CPU. How many cores does the unit have and at what frequency does it work? 
		The more cores a unit has, the more calculations it can perform simultaneously. The higher the clock speed (measured in GHz today), the faster these calculations
		are completed. Along with the main specs of size and speed of your CPU, who are you buying from? There are really two players in the CPU game and that is AMD and Intel. We'll let 
		others debate that quality of each, but they offer competitive processors. If you've bought your motherboard already, then the processor brand you are getting has been decided.
		A motherboard fits a certain socket type and a socket type is associated with AMD or Intel.

		<p>
		Architecture should actually be your first observation, when buying a CPU. This decides a lot about how yoursystem will perform. The decision lies between a 32bit system and
		a 64bit system. This basically refers back to how much data a CPU can move and work on at once. 64bits will obviously be more efficient than 32 bits. However, some systems, for the work
		they will be doing, simply don't need a 64bit architecture. Another important consideration is the limitations of a 32bit system; your operating system must be the version that corresponds to your
		32bit processor. A 32bit processor can only run a 32bit OS. 64bit systems are backwards compatible and can run a 32bit OS. One more important limitation of a 32bit system is only a maximum of
		4GB of RAM can be acccessed by the system, regardless of how much you have on your board. 64bit systems do not have this low-limit, where some 64bit Windows OS support up to 512GB of RAM. An important
		side-note: 32bit is often referred to as "x86".

		Cooling is so important for processors. This is the hottest component on your system. If this unit is not effectively cooled, you do not have a working system. Typically, processors come with
		a three part cooling system; thermal paste, heat sink and processor fan. Thermal paste must always be applied between your heatsink and your processor. It's a special compound that eases the transfer of heat from
		your chip to the heat sink. The heat sink is typically an oddly shaped metal structure that is designed and formed in a way to provide the most efficient dissipation of heat. On top of the heat sink sits
		a CPU fan to simply move the heat away from the cooling system and out into the case, where hopefully additional case fans move the heat out. Please make sure your CPU is properly cooled. The most conventional
		cooling method has been detailed here. Some enthusiasts use liquid cooling, which is a flashy and efficient way to cool an (probably) overclocked processor.

		Some other features to consider for your CPU include hyperthreading. Hyperthreading is cool technology that allows your CPU cores to act logically as more cores on the physical architecture; a dual-core processor acting 
		as a quad-core processor. This is a common technology you should look out for. Also, if you intend to do any kind of virtualization, your processor must support it.
